// pseudocode for TreeSort

In: Array A, size n
Out: Array A has been sorted in increasing order

Let T be an empty Binary search tree
for i=1 to n
   insert A[i] in T
endfor
Perform an inorder traversal of T:
   when the i'th node is visited
   insert its contents in A[i]

running time
-----------

WORST CASE: if the array is already sorted, the 
insertions in the binary search tree will take O(n^2):

The first element is inserted in a tree of height 0, 
the second element is inserted in a tree of height 1,
...,
the n-th element is inserted in a tree of height n-1.
The total sum of these insertions is then O(n^2)

The inorder traversal takes O(n), so the total time
is O(n^2)

AVERAGE/BEST CASE:
The first element is inserted in a tree of height lg1 
The second element is inserted in a tree of height lg2 
The third element is inserted in a tree of height lg3 
The n-th element is inserted in a tree of height lgn

Adding all these up, we get:
lg1 + lg2 + ... +lgn = lg(1*2*...*n) = lg(n!) = O(nlgn)

The inorder traversal takes O(n), so the total time 
is O(nlgn).
